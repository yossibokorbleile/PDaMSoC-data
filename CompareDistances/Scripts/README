This directory contains all the scripts needed to compute
the distance matrices of all the pairwise distances between the contours
in the data set X1Y1. 

1) List of contours:
=====================

   list_X1Y1

   Ordering of the cells in X1Y1. The distance matrices follow that
   order both along the rows and along the columns

2) Cluster informations about the cell contours:
================================================

   list_2clusters

   With the same ordering as in list_X1Y1, provides for each cell
   the cluster it belongs to, with 1 meaning that the cell is
   of type X1 (i.e., a hMSC), and 2 meaning that the cell is 
   of type Y1 (i.e. HeLa cell)

   list_6clusters

   With the same ordering as in list_X1Y1, provides for each cell
   the cluster it belongs to, with:

		1: cell belongs to cluster A of X1
		2: cell belongs to cluster B of X1
		3: cell belongs to cluster C of X1
		4: cell belongs to cluster D of X1
		5: singleton cluster, X1-015
		6: cell belons to Y1

3) Scripts for aspect ratio:
============================

     aspectratio.m		: script that computes the rotation invariant,
			  	translation invariant aspect ratio of one contour

     distances_aspectratio.m	: script that computes all pairwise aspect ratio
				  distances between the 240 contours of X1Y1
				 and stores them in distances_aspectratio.dat 

4) Scripts for elastic distance:
================================

     distances_elastic.m	: script that computes all elastic shape
				  distances between the 240 contours of X1Y1
				 and stores them in distances_aspectratio.dat 

     Note that this script needs the package fdasrvf (see comments in
     distances_elastic.m). If you download it from the Github repository,
     you may see that the file setup.m is missing. I have added it here

     setup.m

5) Scripts for Fourier descriptors:
===================================

     fd_descriptors.m	: 	script that computes the rotation invariant,
			  	translation invariant Fourier descriptors of one  contour

     fd_reconstruct.m	: 	script that generates a curve from Fourier descriptors

     fd_example.m	:	simple example that computes the Fourier descriptors
				of a contour (in cell.dat) and generates 2 reconstructions
				at two harmonic level, M=10, and M = 50

     distances_fd.m		: script that computes all pairwise Fourier-based
				  distances (with M = 10, and M = 50) between the 240 contours of X1Y1
				 and stores them in distances_fd10.dat and distances_fd50.dat

6) Scripts for analysis:
========================

     mds_analysis.m		: 	script that generates a 2D MDS based on a distance matrix.
				It uses gold standard cluster definition for coloring

     roc_analysis.m	:	script that generates a ROC curve based on a distance matrix
				and a gold standard cluster definition
				It also computes a AUC and a pAUC10
