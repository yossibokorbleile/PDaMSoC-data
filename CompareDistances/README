This directory contains all the files that are needed to redo the
analysis in the paper on comparing 5 measures of similarity of 2D contours

These files are organized into 4 directories; note that each directory
has its own README

1) X1Y1_Contours
=====================

   The 240 contours for the combined dataset X1Y1, that includes
   140 hMS cells (X1) and 100 HeLa cells (Y1)

   In all analyses, those cells are organized according to the 
   order in file list_X1Y1

2) X1Y1_distances
=====================

   The distance matrices that include all pairwise distances between
   the 240 contours of X1Y1:

	distances_PH.dat	 : distances based on Persistence Homology
	distance_elastic.dat	 : distances based on elastic shape distance
	distance_aspectratio.dat : distances based on aspect ratio distance
	distance_fd10.dat	 : distances based on Fourier descriptors,
				   up to M=10 harmonics 
	distance_fd50.dat	 : distances based on Fourier descriptors,
				   up to M=50 harmonics 

3) Scripts
=====================

  All matlab scripts to perform the analyses, organized into three groups:

    a) Those that compute individual distances or descriptors:

		aspectratio.m	: Computes the aspect ratio of a curve
		fd_dscriptors.m : Computes the Fourier descriptors

    b) Those that perform the all-pair comparisons:

		distances_aspectratio.m	: Computes (and save) the distance matrix
					  based on the aspect ratio distance

		distances_fd.m		: Computes (and save) 2 distance matrices
					  based on Fourier descriptors, one with
					  up to 10 harmonics, one with up to 50 harmonics

		distances_elastic.m	: Computes (and save) the distance matrix
					  based on the elastic shape energy
					  (NOTE: this script needs the package fdasrvf
					  available at
					  https://github.com/jdtuck/fdasrvf_MATLAB
					  The repository is missing one important file,
					  setup.m; I added it in Scripts.
					  Note also that I am using the function
					  pairwise_align_curves
					  from that package. When run multiple times
					  (like in distance_elastic), I strongly
					  advise to turn off display and printing
					  (Boolean flags in the script pairwise_align_curves).

   c) Analysis scripts:

		mds_analysis.m		: Performs classical MDS and plot the projection
					  on 2 dimensions

		roc_analysis.m		: Performs a ROC analysis, using two different
					  gold standards, one based on 2 clusters
					  (X1 and Y1), and a finer gold standard including
					  8 clusters, 5 for X1 and 1 for Y1

3) Figures
=====================
