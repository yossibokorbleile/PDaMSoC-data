This directory contains all distance matrices for the 240 cell contours
in the data set X1Y1:

1) List of contours:
=====================

   list_X1Y1

   Ordering of the cells in X1Y1. The distance matrices follow that
   order both along the rows and along the columns

2) Cluster informations about the cell contours:
================================================

   list_2clusters

   With the same ordering as in list_X1Y1, provides for each cell
   the cluster it belongs to, with 1 meaning that the cell is
   of type X1 (i.e., a hMSC), and 2 meaning that the cell is 
   of type Y1 (i.e. HeLa cell)

   list_6clusters

   With the same ordering as in list_X1Y1, provides for each cell
   the cluster it belongs to, with:

		1: cell belongs to cluster A of X1
		2: cell belongs to cluster B of X1
		3: cell belongs to cluster C of X1
		4: cell belongs to cluster D of X1
		5: singleton cluster, X1-015
		6: cell belons to Y1

3) Distance matrices:
=====================

There are 240 cells in X1Y1. In consequence, each distance matrix
contains 240 lines (rows), with each line containing 240 values (columns),
separated by space.
Rows and columns are organized according to list_X1Y1

      distances_PH.dat			: distances computed with the PH distance
      distances_aspectration.dat	: distances computed with the aspect ratio distance
      distances_elastic.dat		: distances computed with the elastic distance
      distances_fd10.dat		: distances based on Fourier descriptors, with M=10 harmonics
      distances_fd50.dat		: distances based on Fourier descriptors, with M=50 harmonics
