This directory contains all the data files for the 240 cell contours
in the data set X1Y1:

1) List of contours:
=====================

   list_X1Y1

   Ordering of the cells in X1Y1. 

2) All contours
================

   Each file is a 2 column data file (with a space between
   the 2 columns), each line providing the coordinates of
   one point in the contour.

   Note that the coordinates are in pixels and need to be scaled
   to a physical unit
